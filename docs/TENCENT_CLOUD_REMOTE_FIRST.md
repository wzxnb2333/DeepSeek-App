# Tencent Cloud Remote-First Quickstart

This is the opinionated Tencent-native teaching path for DeepSeek TUI users
who want an always-on agent workspace, a phone control surface, and a stack
that works well from mainland China.

It complements the local install path. If you only want to use `deepseek` on a
laptop, start with the README quickstart. If you want "DS-TUI as a remote
workbench I can control from my phone", start here.

## Default Stack

```text
GitHub main/tags
  -> CNB mirror: cnb.cool/deepseek-tui.com/DeepSeek-TUI
  -> optional CNB build/deploy pipeline
  -> Tencent Lighthouse HK
       /opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui
       /opt/whalebro/worktrees
       deepseek-runtime.service on 127.0.0.1:7878
       deepseek-feishu-bridge.service
  -> Feishu/Lark phone DM

EdgeOne is optional:
  public HTTPS domain -> EdgeOne -> Caddy/Nginx on Lighthouse
```

## What Each Piece Does

- **CNB** is the Tencent-side source and automation lane. The existing
  `cnb.cool` mirror is useful for clones and tagged installs when GitHub is
  slow. Optional CNB deploy templates live under
  `deploy/tencent-lighthouse/cnb/`.
- **Lighthouse** is the private always-on host. It owns `/opt/whalebro`,
  systemd, Rust/Node installs, and the `deepseek serve --http` runtime.
- **Feishu/Lark** is the first phone UI. The bridge uses long-connection mode,
  so the first setup does not need a public webhook URL.
- **EdgeOne** is the public edge only when you intentionally expose a web
  surface such as docs, a status page, or a future webhook endpoint. Do not put
  the runtime API behind EdgeOne.

## First Lesson: Get a Remote Agent Running

1. Buy or reuse a Tencent Lighthouse instance in Hong Kong.
2. Clone from CNB when the branch or tag exists there:

   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL=https://cnb.cool/deepseek-tui.com/DeepSeek-TUI.git
   git ls-remote "$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" refs/heads/main
   ```

   For active feature branches that have not been mirrored to CNB yet, use the
   GitHub URL or manually mirror the branch first. Release tags and `main` are
   the stable CNB path.

3. Bootstrap `/opt/whalebro` on the server:

   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_BRANCH=main
   git clone --branch "$DEEPSEEK_BRANCH" "$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" /tmp/deepseek-tui
   cd /tmp/deepseek-tui
   sudo DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL="$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" \
     DEEPSEEK_REPO_BRANCH="$DEEPSEEK_BRANCH" \
     bash scripts/tencent-lighthouse/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh
   ```

4. Install Rust for the `deepseek` user, build both binaries, and install the
   systemd units using `docs/TENCENT_LIGHTHOUSE_HK.md`.
5. Configure a Feishu/Lark self-built app, fill
   `/etc/deepseek/feishu-bridge.env`, run the validator, then run the VPS
   doctor.
6. From your phone DM, validate `/status`, a harmless prompt, `/interrupt`,
   `/threads`, `/resume`, approval allow/deny, service restart, and reboot
   persistence.

## Second Lesson: Make CNB the Deploy Button

Once the manual Lighthouse path works, copy the non-active examples from
`deploy/tencent-lighthouse/cnb/` into the CNB repository:

- `cnb.yml.example` -> `.cnb.yml`
- `tag_deploy.yml.example` -> `.cnb/tag_deploy.yml`

The intended deploy button should:

1. Run bridge validation/tests and lightweight release-version checks.
2. SSH to Lighthouse with a deploy key stored as a CNB secret.
3. Update `/opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui`.
4. Rebuild/install both binaries.
5. Reinstall/restart systemd services.
6. Run `scripts/tencent-lighthouse/doctor.sh`.

Do not enable this on `main` until the deploy key, target host, billing/quota,
and rollback policy are explicit.

## Third Lesson: Add EdgeOne Only For Public HTTPS

The Feishu/Lark long-connection bridge works without EdgeOne. Add EdgeOne when
you want a public domain in front of a deliberate HTTP service:

- a public tutorial/docs site
- a small operator status page
- a future webhook-mode bridge
- a demo app running on the same Lighthouse origin

Keep these rules:

- `deepseek serve --http` stays bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- `/v1/*` runtime endpoints are never public.
- `DEEPSEEK_RUNTIME_TOKEN` never leaves the server env files.
- Feishu/Lark group control stays off until a specific group allowlist is set.
- Auto-approval stays off for the phone bridge unless a maintainer explicitly
  accepts the risk.

## Teaching Order

Use this sequence when explaining DeepSeek TUI to a new remote-first user:

1. **Local mental model:** `deepseek` is the dispatcher, `deepseek-tui` is the
   companion runtime, and both binaries matter.
2. **Agent safety:** Plan/Agent/YOLO are separate from approval mode and
   sandboxing.
3. **Remote runtime:** `deepseek serve --http` is a localhost runtime API, not
   a public web app.
4. **Phone bridge:** Feishu/Lark messages become runtime requests through an
   allowlisted bridge.
5. **CNB automation:** once manual setup is proven, CNB turns the setup into a
   repeatable deploy button.
6. **EdgeOne edge:** add the public edge after you know exactly what public
   surface you are exposing.
