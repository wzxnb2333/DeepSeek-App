# Tencent Lighthouse Hong Kong Phone Setup

This runbook sets up a Tencent Cloud Lighthouse instance in Hong Kong as an
always-on DeepSeek TUI host controlled from Feishu/Lark on a phone.

If you are teaching this as the Tencent-native default path, start with
[docs/TENCENT_CLOUD_REMOTE_FIRST.md](TENCENT_CLOUD_REMOTE_FIRST.md). This file
is the implementation runbook for the Lighthouse host itself.

## Target Architecture

```text
CNB mirror or GitHub branch
  -> /opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui

Feishu/Lark mobile app
  -> Feishu/Lark long-connection bot
  -> deepseek-feishu-bridge systemd service
  -> http://127.0.0.1:7878 deepseek serve --http
  -> /opt/whalebro
       -> deepseek-tui/
       -> whalescale/ when product work is needed

Optional public edge:
EdgeOne -> Caddy/Nginx public site on Lighthouse
```

The runtime API must stay on `127.0.0.1`. The bridge is the only phone-facing
control surface. EdgeOne is optional and should only front a deliberate public
HTTP service, not the runtime API.

## Remote Whalebro Workspace

Use `/opt/whalebro` as the VPS workspace root. The first-class checkout is
`/opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui`; add `/opt/whalebro/whalescale` if you want the
desktop product repo available from the phone too.

Create these paths first:

- `/opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui`
- `/opt/whalebro/whalescale`
- `/opt/whalebro/worktrees`

Linux is enough for Rust, Node, service work, and most `whalescale-desktop`
web/Tauri development. Mac-only release work such as iOS simulator runs,
`.app`/DMG checks, notarization, and Apple signing still belongs on the Mac.

## Lighthouse Instance

Recommended package for travel:

- Region: Hong Kong (China)
- Image: plain Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or latest Ubuntu LTS
- Size: buy the HK 2 vCPU / 4 GB / 70 GB plan for the first month
- Login: SSH key, not password
- Firewall: SSH open; runtime API on localhost only

Tencent's Lighthouse docs say Linux instances can use SSH keys, and the
Lighthouse firewall opens SSH/HTTP/HTTPS by default.

Use 4 GB RAM for compiling Rust and running the bridge comfortably. A 4 vCPU /
8 GB plan is better for multiple parallel agent workers.

## Feishu / Lark App

Create an enterprise self-built app in:

- Feishu China: `https://open.feishu.cn/app`
- Lark international: `https://open.larksuite.com/app`

Configure:

1. Enable bot capability.
2. Copy App ID and App Secret.
3. Add permissions for message send/receive. The minimum practical set is:
   - `im:message`
   - `im:message:send_as_bot`
   - direct message read permission for your tenant
   - group @message read permission only if you intentionally enable group
     control later
4. Add event subscription `im.message.receive_v1`.
5. Use long connection / WebSocket mode.
6. Publish the app and add the bot to your Feishu/Lark chat.

## Server Bootstrap

SSH into the Lighthouse instance and run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git
export DEEPSEEK_BRANCH=work/v0.8.36-feishu-lighthouse
export DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL=https://github.com/Hmbown/DeepSeek-TUI.git
git clone --branch "$DEEPSEEK_BRANCH" "$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" /tmp/deepseek-tui
cd /tmp/deepseek-tui
sudo DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL="$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" \
  DEEPSEEK_REPO_BRANCH="$DEEPSEEK_BRANCH" \
  bash scripts/tencent-lighthouse/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh
```

If you also want `whalescale` cloned during bootstrap, pass it explicitly:

```bash
sudo DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL="$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" \
  DEEPSEEK_REPO_BRANCH="$DEEPSEEK_BRANCH" \
  WHALEBRO_EXTRA_REPOS='whalescale=https://github.com/Hmbown/whalescale.git' \
  bash scripts/tencent-lighthouse/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh
```

Use SSH repo URLs instead if either repo is private or you want push access
from the VPS.

For the stable Tencent-first path, use the CNB mirror URL once the branch or
tag exists there:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL=https://cnb.cool/deepseek-tui.com/DeepSeek-TUI.git
git ls-remote "$DEEPSEEK_REPO_URL" refs/heads/main refs/tags/v0.8.36
```

The current CNB mirror receives `main` and release tags by default. Feature
branches may need to be mirrored manually or cloned from GitHub until they are
merged or tagged.

If this deployment setup has not been pushed to Git yet, either push the branch
first or copy this checkout to the VPS before running these commands. A fresh
VPS clone cannot see uncommitted local files.

Install Rust 1.88+ for the `deepseek` user, then build both shipped binaries:

```bash
sudo -iu deepseek
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs -o /tmp/rustup-init.sh
sed -n '1,120p' /tmp/rustup-init.sh
sh /tmp/rustup-init.sh -y --profile minimal
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup default stable
cd /opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui
cargo install --path crates/cli --locked --force
cargo install --path crates/tui --locked --force
exit
```

Copy and install the bridge/service files:

```bash
cd /opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui
sudo bash scripts/tencent-lighthouse/install-services.sh
```

After editing both env files, validate the bridge/runtime pairing:

```bash
sudo -u deepseek node /opt/deepseek/bridge/scripts/validate-config.mjs \
  --env /etc/deepseek/feishu-bridge.env \
  --runtime-env /etc/deepseek/runtime.env \
  --workspace-root /opt/whalebro \
  --check-filesystem
```

## Secrets

Generate one runtime token and put the same value in both env files:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
sudoedit /etc/deepseek/runtime.env
sudoedit /etc/deepseek/feishu-bridge.env
```

Required values:

- `/etc/deepseek/runtime.env`
  - `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
  - `DEEPSEEK_RUNTIME_TOKEN`
- `/etc/deepseek/feishu-bridge.env`
  - `FEISHU_APP_ID`
  - `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`
  - `FEISHU_DOMAIN=feishu` for Feishu, `lark` for Lark
  - `DEEPSEEK_RUNTIME_TOKEN`
  - `FEISHU_ALLOW_GROUPS=false` for the first deployment

For first pairing, either:

1. Temporarily set `DEEPSEEK_ALLOW_UNLISTED=true`, message the bot, copy the
   returned `chat_id`, then set `DEEPSEEK_CHAT_ALLOWLIST=<chat_id>` and turn
   unlisted access back off.
2. Or obtain the chat ID from Feishu/Lark event logs and set the allowlist
   before first start.

## Start Services

```bash
sudo systemctl start deepseek-runtime
sudo systemctl status deepseek-runtime --no-pager
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7878/health

sudo systemctl start deepseek-feishu-bridge
sudo journalctl -u deepseek-feishu-bridge -f
```

Run the Lighthouse doctor after both services are configured:

```bash
cd /opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui
sudo bash scripts/tencent-lighthouse/doctor.sh
```

Enable on boot is done by `install-services.sh`; if needed:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable deepseek-runtime deepseek-feishu-bridge
```

## Phone Commands

DMs can be plain text and are the intended first control path:

```text
check git status and summarize what needs attention
```

Group chats are disabled by default. If you later set
`FEISHU_ALLOW_GROUPS=true`, group prompts must start with `/ds`.

Useful commands:

- `/status`
- `/threads`
- `/new`
- `/resume <thread_id>`
- `/interrupt`
- `/compact`
- `/allow <approval_id>`
- `/deny <approval_id>`
- `/allow <approval_id> remember`

Use `remember` only when you intentionally want the runtime thread to flip
toward auto-approval for future tools.

## CNB Deploy Button

After the manual Lighthouse setup passes, CNB can become the repeatable deploy
button:

1. Copy `deploy/tencent-lighthouse/cnb/cnb.yml.example` to `.cnb.yml` in the
   CNB repo.
2. Copy `deploy/tencent-lighthouse/cnb/tag_deploy.yml.example` to
   `.cnb/tag_deploy.yml`.
3. Configure the CNB deploy secrets documented in
   `deploy/tencent-lighthouse/cnb/README.md`.
4. Trigger the `lighthouse-hk` deployment environment.

Keep this manual until the server is boring. Automatic deploys on every push
are convenient later, but they can consume CNB quota and restart the bridge
while a phone turn is active.

## EdgeOne

EdgeOne is not required for the first Feishu/Lark long-connection setup. Add it
only when you need a public HTTPS domain in front of a deliberate public
service on the Lighthouse host.

Good EdgeOne uses:

- public docs or tutorial site
- tiny operator status page
- future webhook-mode bridge endpoint
- demo web app hosted on the same Lighthouse instance

Do not use EdgeOne to expose:

- `http://127.0.0.1:7878`
- `/v1/*` runtime endpoints
- any endpoint that accepts `DEEPSEEK_RUNTIME_TOKEN`

## End-to-End Validation

From a phone DM to the bot:

1. Send `/status` and confirm runtime version, localhost bind, auth state,
   workspace, git repo, branch, and dirty counts.
2. Send a harmless prompt such as `summarize git status`.
3. Send `/interrupt` while a turn is active and confirm the turn stops.
4. Send `/threads`, then `/resume <thread_id>` for one listed thread.
5. Trigger a tool approval and verify both `/allow <approval_id>` and
   `/deny <approval_id>` paths.
6. Restart both services and re-run `/status`.
7. Reboot the instance, then confirm `systemctl status deepseek-runtime` and
   `systemctl status deepseek-feishu-bridge` return to active.

## Operational Notes

- Bind `deepseek serve --http` to `127.0.0.1`.
- Keep the Lighthouse firewall focused on SSH for this setup.
- Use SSH key auth.
- Use `tmux` for emergency terminal work from Blink/Termius.
- Keep `/opt/whalebro/deepseek-tui` on a personal branch while working from the
  phone.
- Keep `/opt/whalebro/whalescale` on its own branch when doing product work.
